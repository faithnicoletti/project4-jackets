## CustomDenim - Your One-Stop Shop for Personalized Denim Jackets

## Introduction
CustomDenim is a web application that offers custom-designed one-of-a-kind denim jackets. 
With a user-friendly interface, users can explore, purchase, and also design their dream denim jackets.

## Technologies Used
- Frontend: React, HTML, CSS
- Backend: Node.js, Express, MongoDB
- Payment Integration: Stripe
- Approach
The project was developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack.
The frontend was built using React, providing a dynamic and interactive user interface.
The backend was implemented with Node.js and Express..

Mongodb was how we created our databases. 
Stripe API was integrated, enabling smooth and reliable transactions during checkout.

As a user, I want to add my favorite denim jackets to the shopping cart for checkout.

As a user, I want to design my own denim jacket by submitting a form with my preferred design details.

## Our Group Project Notes
Despite our diverse schedules, our team coordinated and collaborated exceptionally to achieve full CRUD on our MERN STack application. 
We used Slack and huddled as often as possible to discuss project ideas, project success, and distribute the workload as evenly as possible. 


## Unsolved Problems
We encountered many challenges in implementing functional of the custom design forms, the register/login features, and shopping cart and the Strip Api implementation. 
Further action is needed to complete this application for user use. 
However, full CRUD functionality as a MERN stack application is available. 

## Notes
Explore the implementation of the custom denim jacket design feature to allow users to fully personalize their jackets.
Integrate "Add to Cart" functionality for the available jackets in stock to improve user shopping experience.
Implement Stripe integration to enable secure payment processing during checkout, allowing users to purchase items and remove them from stock.
